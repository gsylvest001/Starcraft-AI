A README to sort steps/tasks by order 

Start the game by sending probes to minerals and produce new workers/probes right away
Once reached a total of 6 probes, send the one of the probes to build a pylon then go mine with others
Once reached 8 probes && got a total of 150 minerals or more, BUILD A GATEWAY
Once reached 10 probes, use one probe to build a secound GATEWAY and a secound pylon
Send that same probe to start the first SCOUT to find enemy base
At all times, at least 1 Zealot should be produced per gateway
